With this plugin you can make passwords a thing of the past*. All you need is your trusty smartphone with a QR Code reading app.

 You’re on the go and the most brilliant idea for your blog hits you. You KNOW that if you don’t post it NOW it won’t be BRILLIANT anymore.
The problem is that you’re out visiting your Aunt Sally and
Your password is so secure even YOU can’t remember it off the top of your head
Aunt Sally has so many junk apps that there are most probably keyloggers installed, and there goes your secure password.
That’s where No More Passwords comes in handy. Log into your blog, keyboard — and remembering — free!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need to log in on my phone? =

You wouldn't want just ANYONE being able to access your site. Verification is still necessary.

= So what's this plugin good for? =

Once you log in once, you won't have to again until your phone cookie runs out (every two weeks or so). That should save you SOME hassle.

= What about foo bar? =

I have no answer to foo bar dilemma.
